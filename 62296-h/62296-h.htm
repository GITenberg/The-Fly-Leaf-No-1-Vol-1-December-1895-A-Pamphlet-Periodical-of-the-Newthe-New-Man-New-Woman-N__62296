<h2 class="nobreak">THE STIR IN LITERATURE.</h2></div>


<p>Of course the most important event of the
month in this favored part of the world is the
unheralded advent of such a robust youngster as
the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>. Oh yes, thank you, Mrs. Grundy,
we are doing very well indeed&mdash;a very healthy
and vigorous infant and a favorite already; and
we may be able to show a very pretty set of teeth
in a month or two, if occasion should demand.
Some of our distinguished contemporaries will
perceive the delicacy of this metaphor; albeit
the babe is quite good-natured.</p>

<p>And now a few words about the aims and purposes
of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> will be in order&mdash;and
the incidental commentary may be found to be
equally interesting. For the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>, although
but the bantling of yesterday, has been nursed
in the lap of harsh experience, and is at least as
wise as some drivelling and decrepit contemporaries
it finds lagging superfluous on the stage.</p>

<p>It is true that the field of contemporary journalism
is already fairly well stocked with various
periodicals, of various shades of unprovoked domesticity,
and innocuous intention in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
imparting that miscellaneous misinformation,
which is the mental stock-in-trade of the millions
everywhere, and put into print day after day,
is the most effective bar to tolerance and growth
and hospitality of thought. But there is plenty of
room for the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>. These highly respectable
publications are all competing with each
other, and reaping the rich rewards that are the
portion of those who have invested their capital
in the impossible virtues and spotless innocence
of the Young Person. They are all reported
to be very prosperous, and we cannot
bring ourselves to believe so highly of human
nature in the bulk as to doubt the truth of their
returns.</p>

<p>But the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> will occupy a field that all
these periodicals regard with the suspicion of
conservatism. It will not impinge on their field,
and they cannot by any possibility intrench upon
its. For it is a magazine of the New, the Modern,
the Young Man, the Young Woman, Today
and its stirring, probing, fantastical spirit.</p>

<p>With the immense reading public that exists
in this land of popular education and enlightenment&mdash;a
public which expands every year, as
generation after generation takes its place in the
ranks of life&mdash;there is room for all sorts of periodicals;
and instead of these various periodicals
being in rivalry, they actually raise up new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
readers for each other. Even the old fogy magazines
have helped to prepare the way for honest
bubbling thought and fancy and humor.
They have unwittingly and unwillingly educated
their readers for the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>. The more literature
is cultivated in America&mdash;the more
writers with fresh opinions and experiences and
ideas increase&mdash;the more readers there will be
to encourage the treatment of ever new and
wider aspects of the complex life of this vast and
complex aggregation of people.</p>

<p>In the pages of these respectable domestic periodicals,
old-fashioned folk, who lived before
thought was let loose in the English tongue
among respectable, law-abiding people, and who
linger on to the confusion of poetry and new
ideas and new interests, can still doze over profound
articles on &#8220;How to Cook a Beefsteak&#8221;
and fiction that has even less relevance to the
comedy and tragedy of real modern life. But all
inspiring literature is drenched in the spirit and
vigor of Youth&mdash;even though the writers may
be only belated boys. It is the New in eternal
nature that entrances the imaginations of thinkers
and poets. The day is coming when the periodicals
now devoted to the dissemination of
the platitudes and ideas of two or three generations
ago will have to awaken to the fact that
the Young Man and the Young Woman of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
era demand the heart of life in their literature,
or they will be compelled to give way to bolder
spirits, such as are now gathering strength in
every modern literature. Already the tide has
set in. Hence the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> belongs to this end of the
century. It is essentially modern. It does not
look to the future, however, with any affected
<i>fin de siecle</i> weariness or ennui, but with the
hopefulness and stirring courage of youth. It
does not aim to be Decadent, or pin its faith to
any particular Ism; although it will always be
hospitable to art and beauty and truth from any
quarter.</p>

<p>The Editor and his coadjutors are of the new
school of younger writers, and they aim to unite
free sincere thought with humor and fantastic
whimsies and imagination; to be serious and
amusing; earnest and honest; but never dull.
The underlying purpose and inspiration of our
efforts will be to strike this Modern note and
awaken this broader Modern spirit, which marks
the literature of our era off from all the ancient
thought and literature of the world.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> will deal with the Here and
Now, with the aims and ideals of the Young
Man and the Young Woman, with the drift
and tendencies of American social and literary
thought. It will embody the New Spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
age that is moving the literature of all the
world, but it will be distinctively an American
periodical.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> hopes that in this struggle for
the recognition of this broader spirit in criticism
and the material of literature, and for the
encouragement of American writers of ability, it
will receive the cordial support of the younger
generation of readers throughout the country.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">THE NEW MYSTICISM.</h2></div>


<p>The latest development of the new mysticism,
or symbolism, or impressionism, which
first came to us from the Continent, has just
reached the Editor of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> from the
pen of an old friend.</p>

<p>It appears that my friend had been reading
Maurice Maeterlinck&#8217;s &#8220;The Blind&#8221; and &#8220;The
Seven Princesses,&#8221; and he had come to the conclusion
that a painful poverty of ideas was palpably
wrapped up in a barren iteration of half
meaningless and half ludicrous phrases. He
then turned to Stephen Crane&#8217;s recently published
&#8220;Black Riders,&#8221; thinking that symbolism
might be a little more coherent and comprehensible
in the alembic of the colder and clearer
Anglo-Saxon intellect and imagination. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
heard Crane&#8217;s impressionistic book of rhythms
spoken of in the inner circles of the New
York and Boston literary world as a collection
of startling psychological pictures&mdash;the Heaven
and Hell of the human soul by flashlight. The
Boozy Prophet, Crane has been called by a certain
eminent critic&mdash;and there&#8217;s invitation to
human nature in such a piquant characterization.</p>

<p>But, for a long while, he labored in Crane&#8217;s
pages, without discovering the secret flame of
spiritual insight that others had spoken of so
confidently, and he began to suspect that the
profundity which had allured so many minds
was simply the fatal lure of the weirdly incomprehensible,
which is the inspiration of a good
many schools of art and new religions. He had
looked for a burst of spiritual light that should
spur his tired imagination to renewed efforts in
setting forth the superior qualities of a certain
brand of coal tar soap which was the inspiration
of his Muse for so much a week. He sank
into the rocker by the fire, and fell into a mood
of despondent reminiscence, weaving all the sad
strands of his life into haunting fancies. Then,
as he says in his letter, a change suddenly came
over him, and he sprang up feeling oppressed
and dizzy with a flood of crimson thoughts that
inspired his brain.&mdash;Ed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Here is his account of what happened.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is something irresistible about this new
mysticism in poetry, which those who have not
pondered over its potent fascinations cannot
understand. It seizes upon the mind suddenly
and without warning. For years all my dreams
of literary achievement and fame had lain buried,
and as I thought, a little sadly, dead&mdash;strangled
by cruel circumstance and devoured by an ever
increasing family. I had become completely
reconciled to writing on tar soap and other commodities.
But all of a sudden my thoughts
seemed to plunge into an abyss of mystical
yearnings after the impossible and infinite, and
then I recalled some of Crane&#8217;s verses with a
new and vivid realization of their photographic
fidelity to perplexity of mind. Then, to my
amazement, I felt the divine afflatus rise overpoweringly
within me, and for the first time in
my life I produced two lines which rhymed.
They ran as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A goblin hung on to the horn of the moon</div>
<div class="verse">A-singing a love song composed by a coon.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I had never performed such a feat as this in my
whole life before, for even in my hours of transcendent
ambition I had recognized the essentially
prosaic bent of my mind. I had always
expected to be a great prose writer, and I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
felt a rather indulgent condescension toward
contemporary poets&mdash;especially those of my
acquaintance. I used to think prose was the
only vehicle of modern thought, and that all the
great poets were dead. But when a man finds
himself beginning to lisp in poetry at a belated
age, his views on the significance of modern
poetry are apt to undergo some important modification.</p>

<p>I thought this couplet a very fair beginning;
but no well rounded thought would come that
had any relevance to the goblin, the moon or the
love song. So I leave the couplet to stand by
itself as a picture, suggestive of the fact that
ambition may miss its mark, but a love song will
surely live in some heart. My next attempt&mdash;for
I was on fire with symbolic rhapsody&mdash;was
a little more successful. I submit it without
comment. The lesson is so obvious.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I saw a bleeding head grinning,</div>
<div class="verse">It grinned at me; I grinned at it,</div>
<div class="verse">In fact, we both grinned irreverently.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But the smiling sun shone on!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I find the longer one delves in mystic poetry
the deeper philosophical problems one can sound
in a very few poignant flashes of symbolic description.
Here is one of my happiest efforts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">As my worn soul lay wriggling in the dust,</div>
<div class="verse">I cried aloud to God in indignation</div>
<div class="verse">That he had so mistreated me;</div>
<div class="verse">But God only laughed, until He&#8217;d like to bust</div>
<div class="verse">And pointed out that dirt was all creation.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I turned off a number of other things, quite
as profound and fantastical, and I find that in
mystical poetry the Deity lends Himself to picturesque
treatment a good deal more readily
than any other person or subject of immediate
and contemporary interest. So that in this way
it leads the mind of the masses away from the
frivolities of the hour to the larger considerations
of life and destiny, and chastens folly with
thoughts of the over-ruling immutable providence
that is too often forgotten in the bustling
cities of civilization.</p>

<p>I send you only one more piece, to which I
have given the dignity of a title. It is &#8220;The
Dissatisfactions of Luxury,&#8221; and is in two stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I heard a man mumbling in the horrid silence of the night.</div>
<div class="verse">He was chaffering aloud with the good God;</div>
<div class="verse">But God in the darkness vouchsafed no sign.</div>
<div class="verse">And I asked him, scoffing, what he desired of the Omnipotent.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I am rich, I am Plutus,&#8221; answered he, angrily,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And I am bargaining for the moon.&#8221;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And why do you want it?&#8221; asked I in amaze.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Because I am tired of all my other toys.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And the price?&#8221; asked I, scoffing, for I bore the badge of Lazarus.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Untold millions, heaped up to Heaven&#8217;s gate.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Fool!&#8221; I cried in bitter derision;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Offer the good God your corrupt soul.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I can make affidavit I never wrote a line of
poetry before in my life, and so I am sorely
troubled at this writing. This is a crisis in my
career. I do not know whether to continue in
my employment as a writer of soap and medicine
&#8220;ads,&#8221; or to devote myself wholly to the
service of the Muses. The question is, am I a
genius, or is this new mystic poetry, which is so
uplifting and inspiring, merely some delusive
imposture of bubbling verbiage?</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THE YELLOW GIRL.</h2></div>


<p>The advent of the Yellow Girl&mdash;the mad, fantastic
siren who is beginning to haunt the hoardings
and our dreams&mdash;is calling forth a good
deal of an outcry among those who hold the
cure of morals in the English public press. It
is rather a difficult undertaking to attempt to
import a ray or two of cheer and fantasy into the
gloom and drab of English life, but some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
English artists, touched with the spirit of the
age, have had the audacity to import the Yellow
Girl from Paris. There she is&mdash;on every hoarding
and bare wall a gleam of light and color and
deviltry, under those dull gray skies, that must
awaken a flash of fantasy here and there in some
toil-worn heart in the crowd, and cheer some
fog born pessimists who would fain forget the
necessities and narrowness of their drab existence.
Instead of the old monotonous clumsy
pictures and unescapable rivers of hideous black
and white catch words, that seemed to emphasize
the limited horizon and freedom of the millions
bound to spend their whole lives in the
great cities, there are ten thousand variations
of the Eternal Feminine in her latest glamor of
gold and yellow, and even under the pall of a
London sky, the very walls open out into the
land of Fantasia.</p>

<p>But the moralists are shocked, and they are
fearful for the future intellectual and moral stability
of England, simply because the Yellow
Girl is the embodiment of an artist&#8217;s dream of
the modern Circe&mdash;a reminiscence of the Bacchantic
dreams that used to fill the poets&#8217; heads in
the old days, before they were all become so very
respectable. It is the artist who now puts a
little diversion and unreal distraction from the
invading ugliness and melancholy of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
metropolitan life into the passing current of our
fancies. The poets used to serve this purpose,
but they are all so anxious to stand well with
Mrs. Grundy nowadays, whereas Mrs. Grundy
and the artists have never really arrived at any
amicable understanding. Old England and civilization
are in no danger from the Yellow Girl.</p>

<p>The moralists, unluckily, have no sense of
humor, and so they fail to perceive that the
masses accept the Yellow Girl as an unreal fantastic
abstraction without any sort of relevance
to the reality of life, which yet stirs the imagination
and puts a little splash of fitful joy into
reality.</p>

<p>A writer in one of the leading English journals
assails the Yellow Girl in a tremendous
tirade, that shows the English intellectual incapacity
for appreciation of the light and good
humored caricature of the superficial aspects of
life, which, by exaggeration, puts the permanent
and beautiful things of life into their true proportions
and tempers sanity of thought with a
gleam of insight into the fantastic range of
human nature that lies always just below the
drab surface of the show of things. The English
mind only seems to understand the coarse
and brutal caricature of Hogarth, with its savage
insistence upon a moral. Hogarth was too
great an artist and observer, however, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have enjoyed and made capital of the Yellow
Girl himself, if he were alive today. The caricature
of today is less obvious, and we may
thank our stars it is. The moralists, like the
poor, we have always with us, and they make
modern life one perpetual din that leaves us no
time for thought, meditation or merriment.
We should be grateful that the hoarding places
do not assail us at every turn with the sort of
caricature that bites into the heart and soul.
There is quite enough sadness in life in the all
absorbing struggle for existence, and I think
that the Yellow Girl is one of those Providential
gifts that keep human life sweet and sane in the
stress of the heartless strife for bread and
riches. She is the creation of the law of compensation
that gives us love and poetry, dreams
and religion, and every other refuge from life.
The moralists and the realists and the rest of
them who would forever pin our minds in the
narrow and sordid round of reality would drive
us all to madness if they had their way. The
fantasy of art and poetry keep life balanced and
sane. Human nature requires this outlet from
the horrid nightmare of sordid sorrow it has
created in civilization. The so-called mad poets
and unhinged artists give us that distraction from
ourselves and our monomaniac absorption in
money-making that saves the world from becoming
one immense lunatic asylum.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>The English moralist describes the Yellow
Girl in somewhat of the fierce contumely of an
ancient Hebrew prophet&mdash;but the Yellow Girl
is not really to be spoken of in the same breath
with Ashtaroth. She is but the phantom of
dreams that pictured or unpictured lives ever in
the heart of youth. But she does not rule life
as did Aphrodite. The moralists should remember
that youth and sorrow must have their
dreams. And all the commonplace virtues of
domesticity are fed upon them. The English
writer bemoans the decadence of soberness in
life in this fashion:</p>



<p>&#8220;The growth of modern life is in great measure
the Parisianising of the civilized world. The
worship of the senses is insensibly taking hold
on the world, and so in the land of Milton and
the Martyrs is set up the flaunting sign of the
growing worship, this hair-brained comedienne&mdash;the
Yellow Girl. Bare armed, bare throated,
great hatted, with parasol a-kimbo, with flapping
gown of gold, and snakey boa bristling in the
breeze, with tripping toes a la Chinoise, with
waspy waist, with painted cheeks and sparkling,
wine-fed eyes, and a monkey grin of daftest daftness&mdash;there
flaunts the Yellow Girl, the she
Baal, the new born goddess of Today, laughing
the amazed to scorn. She is the Spirit of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>This is strong as well as picturesque. But the

come upon in a sudden turning her gleaming,
impish eyes remind us that it is our own fault
if we take life too sadly, for the spirit of fantasy
and joy lurks forever in nature and life. As for
our morals&mdash;they are less safe with drab folk

reminds us that Pan rules in modern life as
much as in the olden days.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS.</h2></div>


<p>The Americans are the most curious people
since the Athenians.</p>

<p>Our big American periodicals buy their &#8220;great
features&#8221; by contracting with the busy bees of the
London literary world, for so many thousands of
words before there are even ideas to be put into
words. It is a way of encouraging literature
which destroys the personality that is the soul
of literature. It develops the taste of readers of
literature by strangling all the original thinkers
and writers who may spring up here in America.
These periodicals aim simply to put before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the public a bill of well known names&mdash;which
usually belong to some of the busiest, most slip-shod
and worthless writers of our time. But
genius two thousand miles away has twice the
potent fascination of genius that lives in Boston
or Hoboken. They command the services of
all the writers of England and the Continent
who are on the topmost wave of the hour&#8217;s popularity,
and whose names and achievements are
viewed in this country through a rosy and delusive
glamor of European reputation that effectually
silences all criticism. If English romancers
cost such a pretty penny, surely no
obscure American critic or man of letters will
dare to be so captious as to declare that at least
half the literature made in England for this appreciative
American people is palpable balderdash,
wholly out of tune with the large democratic
spirit of our age.</p>

<p>Of course we are not going to deny the abilities
of the greatest European writers and artists
of the day. That would be too absurd; and we
thank the good God that a proper sense of
humor is one of the unfailing elements of good
nature, good taste and charm that our readers
may always count upon finding in the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>.
In some cases, they are men of the finest genius,
who would grace the literature of any era; and
it will never be the province of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to decry men who have honestly won their
laurels.</p>

<p>But we have particularly in mind some of the
mere industrious mechanics of letters, who
build their domestic and sanguinary romances
after the pattern desired by the exemplary publishers,
who are most romantic for the dollar&#8217;s
sake. And the publishers have somehow become
invested with the onerous charge of the
world&#8217;s morality, and insist that we poor critics
shall be driven into crime and immorality by
sheer intolerable dulness, and not by any potent
allurements of the sort employed by some of the
delightfully audacious French romancers. If
we must make a choice between the female theological
novelist of the Humphrey Ward stripe
and Catulle Mendes, we prefer to be debauched
morally rather than mentally.</p>

<p>In the case of these eminently successful writers
who are so liberally encouraged to save us
the trouble of producing a native literature
peculiar to the soil and conditions of life and
thought here, it is not too much to say that the
genius is so excellently and artistically simulated
by ingenious puffery, that the average
American reader, gobbling up his culture and
luncheon in one frantic breath, does not stop to
inquire whether this London hall mark is genuine
or fraudulent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>It is not generally known, or even suspected,
in this land of guileless innocence, outside &#8220;the
Trade&#8221; and journalism, that a good many British
authors flourish in American literature as
full fledged masters of the Yellow-jacket, who
are very much more famous in this country than
they are at home. In fact, a crowd of English
mediocrities, of no more significance in their
Grub-street than the most ordinary denizen of
our own Grub Street is here, are received by our
critics and public as writers of the first order of
merit. They flood the American newspapers
and magazines from Portland, Maine, to San
Francisco, until there is actually no sort of
opening left to the men and women who are trying,
under the most discouraging circumstances,
to produce an American literature.</p>

<p>This is due largely to the adroit exploitation
of the literary syndicates, and partly due to the
apathy and timorousness of the American reading
public, that is almost afraid to recognize
American authors without the endorsation of
the London press. And the English critics
damn all American writers on principle.</p>

<p>But the magazine publishers are largely responsible,
as they set the pace in Anglo-mania
in literature; and today about the only circumstance
that is peculiarly American in American
periodical literature is this: the copyright law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
obliges the publishers to have the typography
and printing done in this country. The literature
is all made in Great Britain, because there is
nothing interesting to write about in America
and God does not allow genius to sprout here!</p>

<p>But a stir is beginning to be felt among the
younger people in every city and state of this
country, and the Young Man and the Young
Woman&mdash;as entirely distinct from &#8220;The Young
Person&#8221;&mdash;of contemporary America, are beginning
to want to see this life here at our doors
put into literature, and to read poetry and romance
through eyes in sympathy with modern
life. It will, therefore, be one of the principal
aims of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> to foster and encourage
this new spirit of independence and self-reliance
and faith in the common life and beauty of this
country. There are men and women in America
who have something to say, too.</p>

<p>We protest that the periodicals, ostensibly
appealing to Americans, should deal with the
life and interests here, and should mirror American
literary life and thought. How else are we
to foster a literature here? The periodical world
is the trial arena for the men who may be the
giants of thought and poetry in a few years.
But no arena, no circus; no audience, no gladiators.
Poets and romancers are not produced
when public apathy drives all the writers into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
clerking, or advertisement-writing or journalism.
America is filled with literary talent, and
yet a birch broom is more to be depended upon
than the pen for mere bread, for the American
market is monopolized by aliens.</p>

<p>We are devoured by a plague of locusts.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THE JEALOUS GOD.</h2></div>


<p>In the gloom of the sunless November afternoon
the ordinary solemnity of the old church
seemed palpably increased by an atmosphere
of unusual peace and mystery that gave sorrow
its solace in a sense of the latent and inevitable
sadness of all mortal life.</p>

<p>From one or two of the confessional boxes
there arose a confused murmur of voices, and
under one of the galleries, where the great fantastic
shadows were rather increased than diminished
by a flare of gaslight, a nun was drilling
a bevy of demure little maidens in their catechism.
And every now and again the subdued
chords of the organ rose into a joyous peal and
thrilled and dominated the drowsy, monotonous
sibilant murmur of prayer and clear treble responses
of the children. Then in the hush the
muffled sounds of praying and moving women
seemed to intensify the stillness that filled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
dome and nave, and a sense of isolation in the
midst of life crept over the spirit of one touched
with the human pathos of the scene.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, one of the low, narrow
doors of the main entrance was held open for a
few moments, and the rumble of the traffic in
the crowded streets without surged in with a
music of its own, and the nearness of the whirlpool
of human destiny swept through the minds
of many who would fain put the world out of
their thoughts and lives and find a refuge for all
sorrow in the love of God. Unburdened hearts
thus suddenly invaded by the chill mockery of
reality sought to drown the reawakened memory
of life&#8217;s human web of fate in a fresh abandonment
to all their deepest sorrows and unutterable
hopes in the silence of God&#8217;s House. Here they
would forget the fierce turmoil of the world,
and acknowledge to God all the anguish of
thoughts and soul that none dare reveal to their
fellows. But there is no sanctuary in the world
for the soul of man so sacred that the irony of
life cannot enter.</p>

<p>At the chancel steps the form of a woman was
bent in an attitude of prostrate prayer&mdash;in an
oblivious abandonment of everything but the
passion in her soul, so entirely unusual in a
conventional religious assembly in our time,
that several eyes were directed toward her. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
gray and venerable father who was passing
through the church observed her, and hesitated
for a moment whether he should go and say a
word of comfort to her. But as a sob shook her
frame he murmured to himself, &#8220;She is in the
hands of God and He will restore,&#8221; and with a
little sigh passed on. This was a very poor
parish. The good father was used to pitiable
scenes and the prayers of those whose only
friend in all the world was God&mdash;and even so
the priest had to admit that life was sad.</p>

<p>The woman was oblivious or indifferent to all
that passed about her. Her face was buried in
her hands, clenched together in anguish, and
the sobs that rose and choked her utterance and
swept conscious thought into paroxysms of inarticulate
despair, showed how intensely she
suffered and hoped and doubted. There was no
serenity, no calm acquiescence in her prayer&mdash;it
was all revolt and demand, and in the presence
of the Host at God&#8217;s altar she doubted.</p>

<p>She had purposely withdrawn from the little
groups of women gathered together in their devotions,
and when the door opened and the noise
of the street clashed for a moment with the harmony
of prayer and the low tide of flutey music
from the organ loft, she shrank closer to the altar
railing. The stir of life without struck a
chill into her heart, and all the fervor of her
hopes died within her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>For a few moments her lips were compressed
in the silent anguish that benumbs the mind
and racks the body in every nerve and fibre.
She almost collapsed inertly on the steps. Then
the loathing of life that had possessed her as
she had threaded her way through the narrow,
sordid streets returned with all its dread insistence
of inconquerable morbid thought. &#8220;So
long as men are what they are,&#8221; she said under
her breath, despairingly, &#8220;God cannot be good,&#8221;
and she drew herself up with dry eyes and haggard
face, and mechanically crossing herself as
she gained her feet, she turned to leave the
church without another word.</p>

<p>She tottered slowly and half blindly down the
aisle and only reached the darkened vestibule
with a great effort and several stops on the way.
Putting her hand to the heavy, leathern door,
she found herself too feeble to move it. She
leaned wearily against the wainscot and waited.
No one came. Then, moved with the petulance
of passionate despair, she prayed in her heart,
&#8220;Oh, God, let me out of thy House since thou
wilt not answer my prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now twilight, and she recalled the
flaunting horrors and misery of the squalid
streets of the quarter, and a feeling of revulsion
swept over her. After all, she and her husband
had only God in all the world to look to for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
help and comfort under the burdens of life; for
even the knowledge of misery and sorrow does
not teach men love and pity. And in the cruel
world she only dared to be human with God.</p>

<p>She steadied herself against the wall, her eyes
dimmed with tears, and her soul filled with a
great longing to pour out her repentance, and
again ask the boon that haunted her troubled
dreams as well as her waking thoughts.</p>

<p>She stumbled into one of the nearest pews,
and falling upon her knees she repeated mentally,
with her busy thoughts otherwhere, one
of the prayers of the regular service, and then a
great cry arose in her soul, and she wailed the
prayer that monopolized her heart and mind
day and night, and in or out of church was
always being prayed in all her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord God, we are utterly alone and bereft
in the world, save as Thy presence is near
to comfort us. I ask and pray for only one
thing&mdash;for the life and strength of my poor
husband, who is as Thou knowest wasting at
death&#8217;s door, and in our misery I can do nothing
to save him, nothing to alleviate his sufferings.
Oh, God, I have given Thee this day, to
make my special prayer&mdash;and a day is so much
to the poor, whose bread must be won somehow
every day. Oh, dear Lord, in mercy hear me.
There is no pity, no mercy, no compassion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
among men, for they live only for gold though
they bring their prayers to Thee. Only Thou,
the living truth and God art left to our hope,
and I am here at thy altar to claim the gift of
life Thou hast promised in giving life. Abandoned
and despised, denied and starved by men, I
come to Thee, in our dire extremity, and ask
this boon of life of Thy omnipotent arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so she prayed with all the fervor of her
overwrought spirit, until the dusk reminded
her of the many hours she had been absent from
the sick man in the attic they called home.</p>

<p>As she was about to cross her own threshold,
a hand was laid upon her shoulder in the darkness,
and a voice filled with a love and tenderness
she had never heard in any human speech,
said, softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails thee?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could see nothing, but her soul was
grown desperate, and she answered, without
fear, &#8220;I am troubled for my husband, for his
life is ebbing away, and the miseries we suffer.
I pray only for him, but God does not answer
my prayers.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;And do you pray only for your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we are all alone in the world, and there
are none who care for us, or do for us, or pity
us. We have only God.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&#8220;Then pray for all the world and all mankind,
and perhaps God will hear your prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the sorrowing soul knew that she too
was not without sin, and that out of the House
of God she had met the angel of the Lord.</p>

<p>Just received a book for review, an author&#8217;s
complimentary copy, from one of my friends,
one of the finest hearted, most beautiful natured
men in the world. This is one of the saddest
ironies of life. It is just such a book as I wish
my enemy had written.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The New Woman, who is really new and not
a mere simulacrum of the old fetish masquerading
in borrowed plumage, carries a copy of the
<span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> in the pocket of her bloomers; for
the editor of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> is a New Woman&#8217;s
man, and distinctly prefers her to her grandmother.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is worth the attention of young people
just graduating from our schools and colleges
and entering upon the sad and serious business
of life, as it will put them in the path of success
quicker than all the wisdom of Aristotle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Plato&mdash;and I say this, who spawned it. One
can break all the ten commandments upon a
technicality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A wink is much more innocent than a blush.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the tragedies of old fogyism is the wit
and wisdom of youth. But youth has its little
ironies, and the longevity of old fogeyism is one
of them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Humphrey Ward nightmare is stalking
through the land again already. It is evident
this female survival of the Inquisition has
awakened to the glorious possibilities of the
American market, and in future we may expect
to meet Marcella and the whole string of British
boobies that she has imported (they did not
need creating) into fiction at every turn in our
periodical literature. And we had hoped we
had seen the last of the little snob Marcella and
the rest of them for at least another year. But
the world is pressing Mrs. Ward for the solution
of the servant girl question and she is becoming
more industrious than ever. Subtle
studies of snobocracy seem out of place, though,
in the periodicals of a democratic country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have just seen the latest portrait of Mrs.
Humphrey Ward in the &#8220;Century.&#8221; It explains
the aridity of the atrocious Robert Elsmere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Mrs. Ward&#8217;s physiognomy is severe. She is no
hero to her maid servants and man servants, but
a terror to evil doers. British superiority is in
evidence; but the benignity of genius is not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are certain aspects of Stephen Crane&#8217;s
literature that appeal to the risibilities of a man
who is blessed or cursed with some humorous
perception. His mystic, weird lines outrage all
the laws of prosody, and can only stand as the
audacious flings of a fantastic and untrammeled
imagination, that is impatient of form and loves
the hot splash of thought. But it must not be
rashly judged that any fool can do this sort of
thing. It demands a feeling for words and an
abundant, bubbling imagination. Still, the
grave critics who have seriously accepted Mr.
Crane&#8217;s little book of verses as poetry and literature
of a high order appear in a rather ludicrous
light. It is an interesting freak of a quick
fancy playing over life and thought and taking
all that comes to the surface in all seriousness.
It is, however, something new in print, for the
unchastened whimsies of a perfervid imagination
seldom get into print&mdash;except in a few
periodicals where there is no one appointed to
edit the editor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The article of Jonathan Penn in this number
seems to raise an uncomfortable theory that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sort of inspiration is infectious, and that a million
new poets may spring up any morning.
But Mr. Penn is really only surprised at his own
versatility, which does not surprise us in the
least, for he is one of the most imaginative and
brilliant prose writers in contemporary journalism.
It is a pity that his necessities and the
conditions governing the literary market in
America compel him to write advertisements
for his living. But if Mr. Crane and others can
only manage to put into their serious efforts
such fine limpid prose and such delicious fancies
and quirks of humor as Mr. Penn puts into his
alluring advertisements, a great future awaits
them in prose literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the death of Eugene Field, American literature
has sustained a loss that will not be readily
forgotten, for this whimsical poet of genius won
a place for himself in the hearts of thousands.
His &#8220;Sharps and Flats&#8221; in the <i>Chicago Record</i>
also gained him a national reputation, but it is
the fate of all journalists who succeed in winning
such a place as he held in daily journalism
to waste in the eternal ferment of the short-lived
daily newspaper the fine talents of imagination
and wit, that put into the permanent form of literature,
would give them a place among the
famous wits and humorists of the world. Luckily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Eugene Field was a poet as well as a wit and
droll, and the publisher of the <i>Record</i> was appreciative
and catholic enough to open his columns
to his poetry.</p>

<p>If other American newspapers would allow
their cleverest writers the same latitude of doing
signed work in poetry and prose, we should soon
have a very encouraging group of distinctive
and virile American writers. Eugene Field was,
perhaps, the only American man of letters using
the term in its broad sense, and not restricting it
especially to the writer of merely funny or political
work, who has won fame in literature
through the medium of a newspaper. This is
high praise for the <i>Record</i> as well as a monument
of achievement for Field, which only those
in the harassing harness of journalism can
properly appreciate. At the close of his career,
of course, Field was published in books and
magazines, but he won his reputation in the
<i>Record</i>.</p>

<p>Why do not some other proprietors of large
newspapers give other young American writers
of originality and talent a show, instead of giving
the public nothing in the way of literature but
syndicate matter by English writers who crop
up everywhere? If the newspaper publishers
and editors took to producing literary men of
their own, and were not content to get out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
newspaper that tallies with every other in every
town from Maine to Frisco, we should soon find
that a rich streak of spontaneous, fresh talent
would be struck in this country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Those early &#8220;Plain Tales from the Hills&#8221;
were fine, and &#8220;The Light that Failed,&#8221; and the
rest showed that in Kipling we had a man of
virile force, great observation and picturesque
power. But it seems to one who looks for the
sense of permanence in an artist&#8217;s choice of subjects
and style of treatment that the furore over
the &#8220;Jungle Stories&#8221; is simply the exaggeration
that is meted out to every established literary
favorite in a mere strain for novelty. There
is nothing really permanent about this literary
twist of investing the wild beasts with human
traits and speech, and although it is doubtless
well done, it does not support the contention of
some critics that Kipling is the most significant
and robust writer in English today. This is not
denying Kipling&#8217;s universally acknowledged
abilities, it is merely pointing out that he is
striving more for immediate effect than for the
substantial art that would insure his place in the
great body of standard English literature.</p>

<p>Mr. Harte is a litterateur of the light and humorous sort, with
a keen eye for observation, and an extremely facile pen. His
style is quaint and interesting. He has original ideas and always
an original way of putting things. The writer if not quite a

which he finds in the essay-writing of the good old days of the
English essayists. He will be reminded in many ways of that
happy time, for he will gain the sense of leisure, independence
of democratic opinion, a willingness to be odd if one&#8217;s oddity is
attractive, a touch of the whimsical, and a good deal of straight-forward

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
